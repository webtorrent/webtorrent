# WebTorrent Contributing Guidelines

- Always use WebTorrent for legal downloads.
- Always search for a related issue before starting a new issue.
- Always choose a concise, helpful issue name.
- Always stay on-topic. If you've got a new bug report or feature request, put it in its own issue.
- Always be polite to other people.
- Never post private information, such as torrent or tracker names, IP addresses, etc.

Issues that break the rules may be deleted and locked without warning.

## WebTorrent is an OPEN Open Source Project

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.

## Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

1. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the Git history in any way.
1. **External API changes and significant modifications** should be subject to a **pull request** to solicit feedback from other contributors.
1. Pull requests to solicit feedback are *encouraged* for any other non-trivial contribution but left to the discretion of the contributor.
1. Use a non-`master` branch for ongoing work.
1. Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing code style.
1. Run `npm test` locally before submitting your PR to catch easy-to-miss style & testing issues

## Releases

Declaring formal releases remains the prerogative of the project maintainer.

## Changes to this arrangement

This is an experiment and feedback is welcome! This document is subject to pull requests or changes by contributors where you believe you have something valuable to add or change.
